      <p class="articlebody">Learn more about the Red Bull Foxhunt <a href="https://www.joe.ie/sport/what-exactly-is-the-red-bull-foxhunt-376645">here!</a> The Red Bull Foxhunt takes place from October 4 to October 6 in Co. Down, so before the festivities kick off we want to know what is going on?So what is the Red Bull Foxhunt all about? Will there be any actual foxes involved?</p> <br><br>
        <ol>
            <li> Firstly, no. No foxes will be harmed during the course of the Red Bull Foxhunt – unless a fox is stupid enough to run out in front of a competitor, but we doubt that will happen.</li>
            <li> The Red Bull Foxhunt is a mass start downhill/enduro cycling event that will see 400 competitors battling it out to win the title of 2013 Red Bull Foxhunt champion.</li>
            <li> So there you have it. The 2020 Red Bull Foxhunt won’t feature any real foxes, but it will feature 400 ballsy mountain bikers all eager to reach the bottom of the course as fast as possible.</li>

      <p class="articlebody">Learn more about the Grassroots Enduro Series 2020 <a href="http://grassrootsenduro.com">here!</a> A grassroots Enduro mountain bike racing series run by local clubs with the single goal of encouraging anyone, regardless of age or gender, to try racing in the simplest format. Its success is measured based on the feedback received from those who participate. The one day blind race format is unique in that riders do not get to practice in advance, but can attempt the stages multiple times as they like before the cut-off time (usually a maximum of two attempts per stage). While we encourage newcomers to have a go, the technical standard of most trails and venues is on a par with other regional and national Enduro competitions</p>

      <h2>Bike Park Wales Trip Report February 2020</h2>
      <h5>How do the new lines compare to ours at home? 02/03/2020</h5>
      <section class="articlevideo" style="height:auto;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m3qBA9Z3264" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></section>
      <p class="articlebody"> For intermediate mountain bikers through to seasoned downhill pro's, BikePark Wales will offer you an incredible biking experience unlike anything you have experienced in the UK before.  We even have a 1KM green run for beginners and can offer coaching sessions for riders at any level.The concept is simple, picture a ski resort, remove the snow and replace the pistes with an array of sweeping flowy bike trails meandering  to the bottom of the mountain and you are close.  Add a bunch of adrenalin and big sprinkle of fun and you are pretty much there. BikePark Wales is an exhilarating  way to spend your day in the Welsh mountains.Our series of lift assisted trails for riders of all abilities offer the ultimate riding experience.  With a mix of incredible all weather roller coaster trails and some of the best natural Singletrack the UK has to offer, we challenge you to control the silly grin on your face at the bottom of each run. <br><br> Uplift: Our fleet of mini buses will transport you quickly, safely and comfortably to 491m, the top of our mountain, Myndd Gethin. You will be dropped off at the very top of the hill right next to the start of our trails.  All that remains to do is select your route and whoop and holler your way back to the bottom of the mountain in time to catch the next lift up.

If you would rather not use our uplift and you feel up to the challenge we also have a Singletrack climb so you can pedal your way to the top of the hill before choosing your route down. <a href="https://www.bikeparkwales.com/about-us">Learn more here!</a></p>
